# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- **Benchmark harness + measured perf baseline (Issue #52, WS-A PR 2/8)**: new `bench/` harness — `llama_bench_driver.py` (native llama.cpp CPU matrix: Gemma 4 E2B-it / LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct / Gemma 3 1B x Q4_K_M/Q5_K_M x 4/8 threads x 1k/2k/3k prompts, with a crash-as-data Vulkan attempt mode), `wllama_bench_driver.mjs` (real headless-browser wllama runs, COOP/COEP-present multi-threaded vs headers-stripped single-threaded), and an ONNX embed/rerank cost microbenchmark. Measured, machine-tagged numbers are recorded in `bench/RESULTS.md` (dev-station rows recorded; reference-i5 rows PENDING until the physical reference laptop run — evidence is invalidated by any hardware change). `tests/test_rag_performance.py` and `tests/test_low_end_hardware.py` no longer blanket-skip: they gate on the exact missing artifact and read thresholds from `bench/RESULTS.md` floors (legacy generous bounds as CI-safe fallback). README performance claims now cite `bench/RESULTS.md` instead of restating unmeasured numbers. A new guardrail test (`tests/test_no_blanket_perf_skips.py`) bans unconditional skips in perf-evidence suites and freezes the remaining functional-suite skip debt in an audited, two-sided allowlist. Thresholds and results all flow from `bench/floors.py`-parsed, machine-tagged floors — nothing is hand-patched.

### Fixed

- **`/ask/stream` now actually runs the query and streams (Issue #51, WS-A PR 1/8)**: the handler assigned the unawaited `asyncio.to_thread(...)` coroutine to `query_future` and then called `.done()`/`.result()` on it, so the RAG query never executed and every client received a single `error` SSE event. The query is now scheduled via `asyncio.create_task`, tokens stream as they are generated, and every stream terminates with exactly one `done` payload (containing `sources` and `context_length`, the renderer's done-detection contract) or one `error` payload. Client disconnects now propagate to `engine.query` through a `cancellation_event` (stopping generation instead of burning CPU on an abandoned request), and the cancelled stream ends with a renderer-detectable `done` payload (`cancelled: true`). The API contract is frozen in the new `contracts/api.openapi.yaml` (with `learn[]` / `grounding` reserved for WS-C #72), enforced by the backend-agnostic conformance suite `contracts/tests/run_conformance.py` (run in CI against `api_server.py` via the new `conformance` job, plus a spec-vs-app route drift check), CORS now allows `PUT /settings` cross-origin, a new unauthenticated `GET /health` liveness probe was added, and the previously-never-collected root-level test files moved under `tests/` with a new `scripts/check_test_collection.py` guardrail so tests CI never runs cannot silently accumulate again.
- **API server now binds loopback by default (Issue #51)**: `API_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`. With authentication disabled by default, the old default exposed an unauthenticated document API to the entire LAN. Deployments that need LAN exposure must set `API_HOST=0.0.0.0` explicitly (and are encouraged to enable `ENABLE_AUTH=true`).
- **Chat engine initialization & session lifecycle (Issue #21, CRITICAL)**: the browser-local chat path (`runGeneration`) now `await`s `llmService.initialize(...)` before querying the RAG orchestrator, fixing the default-config "chat sometimes doesn't work" defect where every send threw `"...not initialized. Call initialize() first."`. Also: `ChatPage`'s engine-switch effect now only aborts in-flight generation on an engine switch (no longer disposes anything itself); disposal of the old engine singleton lives in `InferenceModeContext.tsx`'s `setBrowserEngine` callback instead, since that context is mounted for the app's entire lifetime and survives ChatPage unmount/remount — it fires whenever the engine preference changes, regardless of whether the app is currently in browser-local or API mode; single source of truth for the WebLLM model id with a Cache Storage cross-session readiness probe; `getDeviceMemory()` no longer false-blocks wllama chat on Firefox/Safari; stream-setup wrapped in try/catch so a failed/unreachable server URL surfaces a visible error instead of permanently wedging send; SSE close-without-`done` now synthesizes an error completion; readiness-gate in-flight checks deduplicated per engine; streaming path passes the auth token when configured; the model-blocked overlay is now engine-aware with real failure reasons and Retry/Settings actions; WebGPU context-loss watchdog wired end-to-end; Ctrl/Cmd+Enter sends from the chat input.
- **Client-side server-URL validation loosened for self-hosted LAN deployments (Issue #21)**: `validateStreamUrl` now allows private/LAN/loopback/`.local` hostnames (previously blocked) so the app can be pointed at a self-hosted LAN server, its primary deployment model; the cloud-metadata address (including IPv6 forms) remains blocked. Note: there is currently no server-side compensating SSRF control for this client relaxation — see the corrected code comment in `streaming.ts`.
- **Global Ctrl/Cmd+, Settings shortcut (Issue #21, F-KEYBOARD-REGRESSION)**: `useKeyboardShortcuts({ onOpenSettings })` is now registered at the `App.tsx` root (`AppContent`), so Ctrl/Cmd+, opens Settings from every page (Chat, Documents, Settings) instead of only while `ChatPage` happened to be mounted; `ChatPage` keeps its own chat-scoped registration for send/clear-chat (and its model-blocked overlay's own Ctrl+, handling), so the two calls harmlessly double-fire the idempotent navigation while on the Chat page.
- **Settings "Clear Cache" now actually deletes cached model weights (Issue #21)**: `SettingsPage.tsx`'s Clear Cache handler now also deletes the WebLLM Cache Storage entries (`webllm/model`, `webllm/config`, `webllm/wasm`) in addition to the existing IndexedDB/OPFS cleanup; previously it only cleared OPFS and silently left the actual multi-GB model weights cached, so "Clear Cache" did not free the space or force a re-download as the UI implied.
- **WebLLM `modelReady` no longer trusts a stale cache when WebGPU has gone away (Issue #21)**: `readiness-gate.ts`'s `modelReady` computation for the `webllm` engine is now `ready && checks.modelCached` (matching the existing `wllama` branch), instead of `checks.modelCached` alone; a previously-cached webllm model whose WebGPU support has since become unavailable (or whose memory no longer suffices) no longer falsely reports as ready.

### Added

- **Web UI CI workflow (Issue #20)**: New `.github/workflows/web-ui.yml` runs typecheck (app + test configs), build, test, prepare-models, and validate-build on every push/PR — the vitest suite previously had no CI, which was the structural cause of its rot
- **Hardened model-presence probe (Issue #20)**: New `web_ui/src/lib/models/probe.ts` treats `HTTP 200 + Content-Type: text/html` as "not present" (the Vite SPA-fallback signature), wired into `checkPackagedModels()`, `WllamaService.isPresent()`, and `ModelReadinessGate.isModelAvailable()` so a build serving zero model files can no longer falsely report "Packaged Models: Ready"
- **Git-LFS pointer detection in prepare-models (Issue #20)**: `prepare-models.mjs` now detects the `version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1` header (via shared `scripts/lib/lfs-detect.mjs`) and fails loudly, non-zero, on a pointer stub — including a padded stub that passes the size-only check
- **Centralized vitest setup (Issue #20)**: New `web_ui/src/test/setup.ts` registers `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` matchers and stubs jsdom gaps (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver) once for every test file
- **`validate-build --no-llm` opt-out (Issue #20)**: skips the browser-LLM runtime + LFM2-VL weights group for embeddings-only / server-mode builds where the multi-GB LLM weights are deliberately absent. `prepare-models --no-llm` writes `VITE_EXCLUDE_MODEL_GROUPS=llm` into `.env.production` so the runtime readiness gate (`checkPackagedModels`) reports the `llm` group as `excluded: true / ready: true` instead of falsely flagging it missing — a valid embeddings-only build no longer ships with a permanently-broken "models not ready" UI state
- **Web UI test/typecheck tsconfig split (Issue #20)**: `tsconfig.json` (app source, strict, tests excluded) + new `tsconfig.test.json` (tests + mocks, relaxed unused checks) so bare `tsc --noEmit` exits 0 while the full tree is still type-checked
- **Regression tests (Issue #20)**: SPA-fallback presence-probe tests (`probe.test.ts`), `checkPackagedModels()` SPA regression + `--no-llm` exclusion regression, PDF `destroy()` cleanup + pre-assignment-failure tests, and LFS-pointer detection tests

### Changed

- **Single-source-of-truth model manifest (Issue #20)**: `web_ui/public/models/manifest.json` is now the source of truth (declares embeddings, ORT runtime, wllama WASM/compat, and LFM2-VL GGUF/mmproj, each tagged with a packaging `group`); `web_ui/src/lib/models/model-manifest.ts` imports it at runtime so the TS readiness gate and the build validator cannot drift
- **Deploy-aware model base path (Issue #20)**: `MODELS_BASE` is now an absolute path derived from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` against `document.baseURI` — `/models` at the origin root, `/training/models` under a subpath deployment, stable across client-side routing
- **Web UI tsconfig target/lib ES2020 → ES2022 (Issue #20)**: enables `Error` `cause` option and resolves 12 `Expected 0-1 arguments` errors with zero source edits
- **Web UI vitest pool tuning (Issue #20)**: switched to `forks` with bounded `maxForks: 2` and per-file `isolate: true` (each test file runs in a fresh fork, so leaky files are discarded and cross-file leaks can't compound) to eliminate the worker OOM that crashed the default `vitest run`. `memoryLimit: '3GB'` is set as a latent backstop (note: not actively reached for `pool: 'forks'` + `isolate: true`; the OOM protection comes from the fresh-fork-per-file isolation).

### Fixed

- **Web UI does not compile (Issue #20, CRITICAL)**: fixed the block-scope bug in `pdf-extractor.ts` (`let pdf` was invisible to the outer `finally`, causing TS2304 and a latent `undefined.destroy()` runtime crash) and the wrong SheetJS generic in `xlsx-extractor.ts` (`Record<string,unknown>` → `unknown[][]` for `header: 1`)
- **Web UI test suite OOM + rot (Issue #20, CRITICAL)**: the default `npx vitest run` crashed with a worker heap OOM; tuned the pool and quarantined pre-existing unrelated failures (each `test.exclude` entry annotated with its owning sibling PR), bringing the suite to 44 files / 785 passing / no OOM
- **Production build ships sourcemaps (Issue #20)**: `vite.config.ts` now uses `sourcemap: command === 'serve'` (dev only); the offline artifact no longer ships `.map` files
- **247 TypeScript errors → 0 (Issue #20)**: app source and the full test tree now type-check clean via the tsconfig split, `@webgpu/types`, ES2022 lib, and targeted type-only patches. A small amount of new runtime logic was added in `model-manifest.ts` (deploy-aware `MODELS_BASE`, manifest-driven model derivation, `--no-llm` exclusion signal) as part of the packaging-integrity fixes; no pre-existing application logic (chat, RAG, inference, search, settings) was changed.

### Added

- **Message-queue handler documentation (Issue #8, Phase 1)**: Added inline explanatory comments to 5 message-queue handler closures inside `DocumentQAApp._start_message_processor` (`progress_clear_delayed`, `cancel_button_show`, `cancel_button_hide`, `hide_typing`, `model_label`) clarifying their routing purpose and Tk main-thread safety; no behavior or API change
- **Cancel-button routing test (Issue #8, Phase 1)**: Added `tests/test_app_gui_message_queue.py` — 261 lines, 6 tests covering the `cancel_button` show/hide message-routing path through the real `_start_message_processor` dispatch
- **Chat Experience redesign (Phase 2)**: Complete overhaul of chat UI for improved usability:
  - `ChatMessageList.tsx`: Centered transcript layout (768px max-width) with rich empty state featuring hero heading "How can I help with your documents?" and 3 clickable suggested prompt cards
  - `ChatMessageBubble.tsx`: Assistant messages now render as full-width prose (no bubble background/radius); user messages remain 75% width bubbles; copy button moved to action row below content
  - `ChatInput.tsx`: Composer redesigned as raised card with 20px radius (`--radius-lg`), focus feedback (border color change + shadow intensification), elevation shadow, and 12px radius buttons (`--radius-md`)
  - `ChatPage.tsx`: `onSuggestedPrompt` handler wired to `handleSend` for immediate prompt card activation

### Changed

- **Design token foundation (Phase 1)**: Comprehensive design system overhaul establishing the UI/UX baseline:
  - **Color system**: Added 5 new semantic tokens (`--color-info`, `--color-warning`, `--color-success`, `--color-primary-rgb`, `--color-text-primary`) with dark mode overrides; fixed DD-C01 critical bug where LoadingOverlay used undefined tokens
  - **Typography**: Migrated to Inter font (self-hosted via @fontsource/inter, weights 400/500/600/700); updated type scale to 6-level hierarchy (display=32px, h1=24px, h2=20px, h3=17px, body=15px, caption=13px, small=11px); added line-height tokens (`--line-height-body: 1.6`, `--line-height-heading: 1.3`, `--line-height-tight: 1.2`)
  - **Spacing**: Migrated from 4px grid to 8px grid (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px); compound spacing presets re-aligned to 8px grid
  - **Radius**: New token system (`--radius-sm: 6px`, `--radius-md: 12px`, `--radius-lg: 20px`, `--radius-xs: 4px`)
  - Dependencies: Added `@fontsource/inter@^5.2.8`

- **Streaming message persistence**: stream_end handler now calls `_add_message` before destroying frame; `_streaming_finalized` guard prevents double-finalization; `_finalize_streaming_message()` helper extracted (Task 1.1)
- **Chat history bounded to 50 messages**: Oldest messages pruned when limit exceeded; configurable via `CHAT_HISTORY_MAX_MESSAGES` and `CHAT_HISTORY_PRUNE_COUNT` constants (Task 3.1)
- **Message queue validation**: Malformed messages logged and skipped before processing; prevents crashes from invalid queue entries (Task 4.1)
- **Exception logging**: Previously silent except blocks now log via `logging.getLogger("app_gui")` for debugging (Task 4.2)

### Changed
- **Cancel button behavior**: Now appears during all background operations (engine init, ingestion, querying) and disappears when operation completes or is cancelled
- **Escape key handler**: Delegates to `_cancel_operation()` when an operation is active, providing consistent cancellation behavior
- **Button border width**: All buttons created via `_make_button()` now consistently use `border_width=1` (standardized from Task 5.1)

### Fixed
- **Non-streaming chat_complete return**: Fixed missing `return cleaned` in GGUFBackend.chat_complete() non-streaming branch that caused LLM responses to be discarded
- **QueryTransformer race condition**: Added `_query_transformer_failed` check inside `_init_lock` double-check to prevent retry storms after failure

- **Security**: Added non-HTTP scheme rejection, 0.0.0.0 binding rejection, null-byte injection prevention, path traversal protection
- **UI/UX**: Segoe UI font, 36px button height, accessibility labels, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+Enter, Escape), progress animation
- **Error handling**: Structured logging (replaced print()), TimeoutError classification, SettingsProxy AttributeError wrapping
- **Resilience**: Lazy loading for embedding model, BM25, and SentenceTransformer; try/except wrappers on all I/O
- **Build system**: Updated PyInstaller spec, removed Ollama env vars from build scripts
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed unused validate_numeric(), validate_device(), legacy model fallbacks, deprecated import aliases

### Added
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Enter to submit questions, Escape to clear input/cancel operations, Ctrl+L for clear chat, Ctrl+, for settings
- **Inline typing indicator**: "Thinking..." animation in chat area during processing (replaces status bar overwrite)
- **Clear chat confirmation**: Two-click confirm pattern with 3-second timeout to prevent accidental deletion
- **Settings switch labels**: CTkSwitch widgets with descriptive text ("Enable Hybrid Search", "Enable Reranking")

### Removed
- OpenVINOLLM backend and OpenVINO dependencies
- OllamaLLM backend and Ollama configuration
- OpenAICompatibleLLM backend and API configuration
- Dead CLI arguments (--model-path, --ollama-url, --api-url, etc.)
- Legacy model filename fallbacks (phi3-mini-int4.gguf, phi3.5-mini-instruct-int4-cw-ov)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-12

### Changes

#### SettingsDialog Simplification (Task 3.2)
- **app_gui.py**: Removed backend priority label showing "GGUF → Ollama → OpenAI-Compatible" order
- **app_gui.py**: Removed all Ollama-related widgets (URL entry, Model entry, Test button)
- **app_gui.py**: Removed all API-related widgets (URL entry, Model entry, Test button)
- **app_gui.py**: Removed `_test_ollama()` method
- **app_gui.py**: Removed `_test_api()` method
- **app_gui.py**: Updated `_populate_fields()` to remove ollama_url, ollama_model, api_url field insertions
- **app_gui.py**: Updated `_save()` to remove ollama_url, ollama_model, api_url from saved settings
- **app_gui.py**: Updated `_load_settings()` to remove ollama_url, ollama_model, api_url from default settings
- **app_gui.py**: Replaced bundled_models list (with 3 legacy models) with single Gemma 4 model

### Migration Notes
Settings dialog now only supports:
- GGUF Model Path (with Browse button)
- RAG Settings (chunk_size, n_results, max_tokens, temperature)
- Advanced RAG Settings (hybrid_search, retrieval_window, reranking)

Users who previously used Ollama or OpenAI-compatible API backends must:
1. Obtain a GGUF model file (.gguf format)
2. Configure the GGUF Model Path in Settings

For environment variable configuration (advanced users):
- Ollama: Set `RAG_OLLAMA_URL` and `RAG_OLLAMA_MODEL` in environment
- API: Set `RAG_API_URL` and `RAG_API_MODEL` in environment

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Summary
UX Phase 1-5: Fixed critical backend fallback bug, improved API types, error messages, and Settings UI.

### Phase 1 — Chat Fallback Fix (D1)
- **llm_interface.py**: `answer_question()` now iterates all backends explicitly (GGUF tries chat_complete then generate; non-GGUF uses generate). Previously only tried backends[0].

### Phase 2 — API Typed Models (A1-A5)
- **api_server.py**: Added `LoginRequest` Pydantic model for `/auth/token`
- **api_server.py**: Added `DocumentsResponse`/`DocumentInfo` using `engine.get_all_documents()` for `/documents`
- **api_server.py**: Root `GET /` now returns `version`, `docs`, `auth_status`
- **api_server.py**: Auth-disabled at `/auth/token` now returns HTTP 503 (was 400)

### Phase 3 — API Exception Handlers (A6-A7)
- **api_server.py**: Added `RequestValidationError` custom handler returning structured `{"detail", "errors"}`
- **api_server.py**: Added global catch-all `Exception` handler with correlation ID

### Phase 4 — Error UX (B1-B2)
- **app_gui.py**: Added `_classify_error()` helper — connection/timeout/token-limit errors now show actionable messages instead of raw exceptions
- **llm_interface.py**: OpenAI-compatible URLError now appends "Is the server running?"

### Phase 5 — Settings UI (C1-C3)
- **app_gui.py**: Added backend priority hint label ("GGUF → Ollama → OpenAI-Compatible")
- **app_gui.py**: Added "Test" buttons for Ollama URL and API URL
- **app_gui.py**: Status bar now shows `Ready (Backend / model-name)` instead of just backend name

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-12

### Summary
Fixed all failing regression and unit tests; improved RAG pipeline quality.

### Test Fixes
- **test_defect_001_gui_gguf_wiring**: Fixed sys.modules mock pollution — use rag_engine.RAGEngine direct replacement instead of patch() decorator
- **test_defect_002_api_gguf_env**: Fixed validate_model_path mock side_effect (was returning lambda instead of calling it)
- **test_defect_003_adversarial**: Added control char detection, fixed userinfo regex, updated error messages, added loopback keyword to match pattern
- **test_api.py**: Fixed StatsResponse documents field, mocked DNS resolution, fixed error messages
- **test_llm_interface.py**: Fixed OLLAMA connection error mock with side_effect
- **test_phase1_adversarial.py**: Updated error message matches for URL validation changes
- **test_phase1_fixes.py**: Added socket.getaddrinfo mock for DNS resolution

### RAG Pipeline Quality
- Added CrossEncoder reranking with TinyBERT (ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2, ~85MB) — enabled by default
- Sentence-boundary truncation (no more mid-sentence cuts)
- 3-pattern follow-up query detection (anaphora, short non-WH, continuation keywords)
- Expanded conversation history (2 turns, 4 messages)
- Strengthened system prompt (5 rules)

### Security Hardening
- Control character detection in validate_url (\x00-\x08, \x0a-\x0d, \x0e-\x1f)
- Userinfo detection regex (urlparse only catches non-empty usernames)
- Proper ValueError on unresolvable hostnames (not silent return)
- Centralized security.py module with validate_device()

### API Improvements
- StatsResponse now returns documents field
- validate_device() for device string command injection protection
- Centralized config.py with Pydantic validation

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-12

### Summary
Pipeline optimization: wired three dead features, fixed page citation, improved answer quality.

### Phase 1 — Dead Feature Activation

#### Reranker Wiring
- **Wired CrossEncoderReranker** into `RAGEngine.query()` — was fully implemented but never connected
- **Switched to TinyBERT** (`ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2`, ~85MB) from MiniLM (~500MB) — safe for 8GB RAM minimum spec
- Reranking now **enabled by default** (`reranking_enabled=True`)
- Lazy initialization — model loads on first query, not at startup

#### Retrieval Window
- **Wired `retrieval_window`** from config through to `vector_store.get_context()`
- Neighbor expansion (`_expand_chunks_with_neighbors`) was already implemented — was never called
- Default window of 1 now works: retrieved chunks are expanded ±1 neighbor from the same source document

#### Query Transformation
- Kept disabled (step-back LLM call adds 2-5s latency on CPU — unacceptable for minimum spec)
- Keyword-only extraction available when enabled

### Phase 2 — Ingestion Quality

#### Page Number Assignment
- **`_find_page()` helper** added to `chunk_text()` — maps chunk text to PDF page via longest-prefix matching against `para_page_map`
- All three `DocumentChunk` creation sites now set `page=_find_page(chunk_text)`
- PDF pages now carry through to metadata — enables page-level citations
- Fixed `_split_sentences()` Python 3.13 compatibility: replaced invalid `r'\1\x00'` replacement string with callback function

### Phase 3 — QA Output Quality

#### Sentence-Boundary Truncation
- **`_truncate_at_sentence()`** helper replaces raw char-level truncation
- Scans backward from cutoff for last complete sentence (`.` `!` `?` followed by space/newline)
- Fallback to word boundary — no more mid-sentence cuts sent to the LLM

#### System Prompt
- Strengthened with 5 rules: no speculation, full context inclusion, conflict handling (all perspectives), inline citations `[filename.pdf]`, bullet points for multi-step answers

#### Follow-Up Detection
- Replaced brittle keyword+length check with 3-pattern detection:
  - Pronoun/anaphora (`it`, `this`, `that`, `these`, `those`)
  - Short non-WH questions (≤4 words not starting with what/who/when/where/which/how/why)
  - Continuation keywords (`more`, `elaborate`, `compare`, `vs`, etc.)

#### Conversation History
- Expanded from 1 turn to 2 turns (last 2 user + 2 assistant messages)
- Increased char limit to 250 (display at 100 chars per line)

### Documentation Updates
- ARCHITECTURE.md: Updated reranking defaults (True / TinyBERT), added retrieval_window, fixed reranking code example
- CONFIGURATION.md: Updated `RAG_RERANKING_ENABLED` default to `True`, `RAG_RERANKER_MODEL` to TinyBERT
- README.md: Updated reranker description (TinyBERT, default ON), clarified step-back is not wired
- USAGE.md: Updated reranking default to ON
